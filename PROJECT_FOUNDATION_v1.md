# MITA 3.0 Self-Assessment Tool — Project Foundation

## Overview

A Progressive Web App (PWA) enabling Medicaid agencies to self-assess their MITA (Medicaid Information Technology Architecture) maturity. The application is fully client-side, offline-first, and stores all data locally in the browser.

**Project Start Date:** January 7, 2026  
**Target Deployment:** GitHub Pages (`naretakis.github.io/mita-3.0-ssa`)

---

## Core Principles

1. **Privacy First**: All data stays in the browser. No data transmitted or stored remotely.
2. **Offline First**: Full functionality after initial load, even without network.
3. **Accessibility**: Government-appropriate, conservative UI that works for policy audiences.
4. **Simplicity**: MVP scope — no feature creep.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Build Tool | Vite | Fast builds, native ESM, simpler than Next.js for static apps |
| Framework | React 18 | Industry standard, large ecosystem |
| Language | TypeScript | Type safety, better DX, catches errors early |
| Routing | React Router v6 | De facto standard for React SPAs |
| UI Library | Material UI (MUI) v5 | Conservative design, accessible, well-documented |
| State Management | React Context + Hooks | Sufficient for app complexity, no Redux overhead |
| Client Storage | Dexie.js | Clean API over IndexedDB, reactive queries |
| PWA | vite-plugin-pwa | Workbox-based, well-maintained, Vite-native |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages | Free, simple, fits static export model |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Native to GitHub, straightforward deployment |

### Why Vite over Next.js?

Next.js excels at server-side rendering, API routes, and hybrid apps — features this project doesn't need. For a 100% client-side, static PWA:

- Vite has simpler configuration (no `output: "export"` workarounds)
- `vite-plugin-pwa` is more straightforward than `next-pwa`
- Smaller bundle size (no Next.js runtime)
- Faster development server
- "Just React" mental model — no server/client component distinctions

## Data Source

**Repository:** [github.com/naretakis/mita-open-blueprint](https://github.com/naretakis/mita-open-blueprint)

### Structure

```
data/
├── bcm/    # Business Capability Models (72 files)
│   ├── business_relationship_management/
│   ├── care_management/
│   ├── contractor_management/
│   ├── eligibility_and_enrollment_management/
│   ├── financial_management/
│   ├── operations_management/
│   ├── performance_management/

│   └── provider_management/
└── bpt/    # Business Process Templates (72 files)
    └── [same structure as bcm/]
```

### Business Areas & Capability Counts

| Business Area | Code | Capabilities |
|---------------|------|--------------|
| Business Relationship Management | BR | 4 |
| Care Management | CM | 9 |
| Contractor Management | CO | 9 |
| Eligibility & Enrollment Management | EE | 4 |
| Financial Management | FM | 19 |
| Operations Management | OM | 9 |
| Performance Management | PE | 5 |
| Plan Management | PL | 8 |
| Provider Management | PM | 5 |
| **Total** | | **72** |

### BCM Structure (Maturity Assessment)

Each BCM file contains:
- `business_area`: High-level grouping
- `process_name`: Specific capability name
- `process_code`: Two-letter abbreviation
- `maturity_model.capability_questions[]`: Array of 4-15 questions
  - `category`: Question grouping
  - `question`: The assessment question
  - `levels`: Object with `level_1` through `level_5` descriptions

### BPT Structure (Process Documentation)

Each BPT file contains:
- `process_details.description`: Full process description
- `process_details.trigger_events[]`: What initiates the process
- `process_details.process_steps[]`: Ordered list of steps
- `process_details.results[]`: Expected outcomes
- `process_details.shared_data[]`: Data sources used
- `process_details.predecessor_processes[]`: Upstream processes
- `process_details.successor_processes[]`: Downstream processes

### Data Loading Strategy

**Decision:** Bundle all JSON into the app (Option A)

**Rationale:**
- Guarantees offline functionality immediately
- Simpler implementation (no fetch/cache logic)
- Total data size (~2-3MB) is acceptable for initial load
- Updates require app rebuild, but data changes infrequently

## Data Model (Dexie/IndexedDB)

### Assessments Table

```typescript
interface Assessment {
  id: string;                    // UUID
  name: string;                  // "Assessment - Jan 7, 2026"
  status: 'draft' | 'in_progress' | 'finalized';
  blueprintVersion: string;      // "3.0"
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  finalizedAt?: Date;
}
```

### Assessment Capabilities Table

```typescript
interface AssessmentCapability {
  id: string;                    // UUID
  assessmentId: string;          // FK to Assessment
  capabilityCode: string;        // "CM_Establish_Case"
  businessArea: string;          // "Care Management"
  processName: string;           // "Establish Case"
}
```

### Ratings Table

```typescript
interface Rating {
  id: string;                    // UUID
  assessmentId: string;          // FK to Assessment
  capabilityCode: string;        // "CM_Establish_Case"
  questionIndex: number;         // 0-based index into capability_questions
  level: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | null;
  notes: string;
  carriedForward: boolean;       // True if copied from previous assessment
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Indexes

- `assessments`: by `status`, by `updatedAt`
- `assessmentCapabilities`: by `assessmentId`
- `ratings`: by `[assessmentId, capabilityCode]`

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Assessment Granularity

**Decision:** Users rate each BCM question individually (not one rating per capability).

**Rationale:** This matches the BCM structure — each question has its own 5-level maturity scale. Provides granular data without inventing new criteria.

### 2. Assessment Lifecycle

```
draft → in_progress → finalized
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `draft` | Just created, no ratings yet |
| `in_progress` | Has some ratings, actively being worked |
| `finalized` | Complete, represents "current" assessment |

**Finalized assessments can be edited** (for typo fixes, etc.). The `finalizedAt` timestamp records when it was marked complete; `updatedAt` tracks subsequent edits.

### 3. Data Carry-Forward

**Decision:** When creating a new assessment from a finalized one, copy all ratings with `carriedForward: true`.

**Rationale:** Industry standard for recurring assessments. Users get a starting point but are prompted to review (UI shows indicator on carried-forward items).

### 4. Capability Selection

**Decision:** Hierarchical picker — select business area first, then capabilities within it. Users can select capabilities from multiple areas.

**Future Enhancement:** Support "modern groupings" via a separate `category-mappings.json` file (not modifying original CMS data). This is deferred post-MVP.

### 5. Assessment Naming

**Decision:** Auto-generate date-based names with option to rename.

**Format:** `Assessment - Jan 7, 2026` (with suffix `(2)`, `(3)` for same-day duplicates)

**Rationale:** Reduces friction to start; users can rename for clarity.

### 6. Blueprint Versioning

**Decision:** Store `blueprintVersion` with each assessment. No migration between versions.

**Rationale:** If blueprint data changes, users start fresh assessments on new versions. Keeps implementation simple.

### 7. Notes

**Decision:** Per-question notes (not per-capability).

**Rationale:** More useful for documenting rationale ("We're Level 2 because we still use fax for X").

### 8. Progress Indicators

**Decision:** Show both overall assessment progress and per-capability progress.

**Calculation:** `(questions answered) / (total questions) * 100`

### 9. Mobile Experience

**Decision:** Fully responsive — works on phone, optimized for desktop/tablet.

**Implementation:** Collapsible sidebars, responsive layouts, touch-friendly controls.

### 10. Auto-Save & Navigation

**Decision:** All changes auto-save immediately. No "Save" button, no unsaved data warnings.

**Rationale:** Reduces cognitive load, prevents data loss, matches modern app expectations.

### 11. Status Transitions

**Decision:** Status automatically updates based on user actions:
- `draft` → `in_progress`: When first rating is saved
- `in_progress` → `finalized`: Manual action by user
- `finalized` → `finalized`: Edits allowed, status unchanged

### 12. Session Persistence

**Decision:** Remember last-viewed capability within an assessment session.

**Implementation:** Store `lastCapabilityCode` in localStorage keyed by assessment ID. On return, scroll/navigate to that capability.

## UI Patterns & Behaviors

### Empty States

| Screen | Empty State Message |
|--------|---------------------|
| Dashboard (no assessments) | "No assessments yet. Create your first assessment to get started." + prominent CTA |
| Assessment sidebar (no capabilities) | Should not occur — assessment requires at least one capability |

### Confirmation Dialogs

| Action | Dialog Content |
|--------|----------------|
| Delete Assessment | "Delete [Assessment Name]? This will permanently remove all ratings and notes. This cannot be undone." |
| Finalize Assessment | "Mark [Assessment Name] as finalized? You can still edit it later if needed." |

### Toast/Snackbar Notifications

| Event | Message | Duration |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Assessment created | "Assessment created" | 3s |
| Assessment deleted | "Assessment deleted" | 3s |
| Assessment finalized | "Assessment finalized" | 3s |
| Rating saved | No toast (silent auto-save) | — |
| Offline detected | "You're offline. Changes are saved locally." | 5s |
| Back online | "You're back online." | 3s |

### Auto-Save Behavior

- Every rating change saves immediately to IndexedDB
- No explicit "Save" button needed
- Assessment `updatedAt` timestamp updates on each change
- Status automatically transitions from `draft` → `in_progress` on first rating

### Navigation Guards

- No unsaved data warnings needed (auto-save handles this)
- User can freely navigate between capabilities and pages
- Returning to an assessment resumes at the last viewed capability (store in session/local storage)

### Keyboard Navigation

- Tab through form controls in logical order
- Enter/Space to select maturity levels
- Arrow keys to navigate between maturity level options
- Escape to close modals/dialogs
- Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements

### Storage Considerations

**IndexedDB Quota:**
- Modern browsers provide 50MB+ for IndexedDB
- Our data footprint is minimal (text-based ratings and notes)
- No quota issues expected for typical usage

**If quota exceeded (edge case):**
- Show error toast: "Storage limit reached. Please delete old assessments."
- Prevent new assessment creation until space freed

---

## PWA Configuration

### Service Worker Strategy

Using `vite-plugin-pwa` with Workbox:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
VitePWA({
  registerType: 'autoUpdate',
  workbox: {
    globPatterns: ['**/*.{js,css,html,ico,png,svg,json}'],
    runtimeCaching: [
      {
        urlPattern: /^https:\/\/fonts\.googleapis\.com\/.*/i,
        handler: 'CacheFirst',
        options: {
          cacheName: 'google-fonts-cache',
          expiration: { maxEntries: 10, maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 }
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  manifest: {
    name: 'MITA Self-Assessment Tool',
    short_name: 'MITA SS-A',
    description: 'Self-assess your Medicaid IT maturity',
    theme_color: '#1976d2',
    icons: [
      { src: 'pwa-192x192.png', sizes: '192x192', type: 'image/png' },
      { src: 'pwa-512x512.png', sizes: '512x512', type: 'image/png' }
    ]
  }
})
```

### Offline Behavior

- App shell (HTML, JS, CSS) cached on first load
- All blueprint JSON bundled and cached
- IndexedDB data persists across sessions
- Full functionality without network after initial load

---
